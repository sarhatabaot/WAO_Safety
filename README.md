# Goals
This project consists of a weather monitor, that reades real time data from measuring devices, and saves it to
the database.


## Understandings & TODO (Omer)
This project uses Python 3.8. And doesn't actually use a local virtual env.
This may cause issue for different developers. Ensure that the correct requirements are set properly.

I initially upgraded some dependencies but realized my error may be caused by an incorrect python version.
3.12 over 3.8

### Trying with 3.8
Live as well in case db falls
### Consider moving to a VENV
This can isolate issues to a specific env. i.e. each script will run in it's own version and we don't experience issue between scripts.
