# The following sections define sensors that contribute to the is_safe/unsafe decision.
# Each sensor contributes its is_safe/unsafe value.  The system is is_safe iff ALL the sensors are 'is_safe'.
# Sensors can be:
# - one-shot: ('nreadings' == 1, default if no 'nreadings'). Only the latest reading is considered
# - cumulative: ('nreadings' > 1).  A number of values are remembered
#   - The sensor is 'is_safe' IFF all the values are 'is_safe'
#   - If the sensor changes from 'unsafe' to 'is_safe' it will remain 'unsafe' for a 'settling' [seconds] period to
#      prevent jitter.  It will become is_safe ONLY if ALL values are is_safe after the 'settling' period
#
# Sensor attributes:
# - 'source':       [station:value] where is it obtained from (e.g. davis:humidity)
# - 'nreadings':    [int]           how many values are remembered (default: 1)
# - 'min', 'max':   [float, float)  the safety range.  (default: 'min' == 0)
